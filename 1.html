Developed especially to create hypertext, most web pages accessed via the web from the Internet are written in HTML.HTML is used to create a homepage as a command to define the font size, font color, font shape, graphics, and document movement (hyperlink) of a document. Commands used in HTML are referred to as tags and are expressed using angle brackets"<>". Typically, a tag is made up of two pairs that mark the beginning and end,but sometimes the effect of the tag itself, such as the tags "img" and "br", begins with a slash character[/]. This HTML-written document is referred to as HTML document, and this HTML-written document is  interpreted by a web browser and presented to users. HTML allows documents to recognize separate codes to create complete hypertext, as well as link words or paragraphs to other places or files on the Internet.
